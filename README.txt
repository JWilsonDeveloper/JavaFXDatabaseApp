Directions:
• Launch the program.
• Type in your username and password at the login screen. (Username: "test", Password: "test")
• Click on the button labeled "Submit".
• A successful login will take you to the main menu. An alert message will appear to inform you whether or not there are any ongoing appointments, or any appointments starting within 15 minutes. Once you've read the alert, click the X button at the top right of the message box or click the button labeled "OK".
• From the main menu you can create, update, and delete appointments and customers. To view reports, click on the button labeled "Reports" at the bottom of the main menu.
• To close the program, click the X button at the top right of the window, or navigate to the main menu and click the button labeled "Log Out". Then click the button labeled "Exit" at the bottom right of the login screen.

Additional Report: In addition to the two specifically defined reports required for this assignment, for my third report I chose to create a table that displays the number of customers in each country. The table can be viewed alongside the other two reports on the Reports Menu, which can be accessed by clicking the button labeled "Reports" at the bottom of the main menu.
